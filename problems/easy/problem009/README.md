# 9. Palindrome Number

Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

**Example 1:**

> Input: x = 121 <br>
> Output: true <br>
> Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

**Example 2:**

> Input: x = -121  <br>
> Output: false <br>
> Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

**Example 3:**

> Input: x = 10  <br>
> Output: false  <br>
> Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

**Constraints:**

- `-231 <= x <= 231 - 1`
